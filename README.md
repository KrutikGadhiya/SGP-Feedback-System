# Feedback System or FeedSys

Feedbacks are an important part of any institution/organization especially for educational institutes, because feedback gives the idea about the overall quality. Also based on the feedback the institutes can improve the quality of education.

In any educational institution/organization, it is difficult to maintain the quality of education, and on top of that students have fear of giving proper feedback to the faculty/course, that would not be good for any institution. so with this project institutes can create feedbacks and students can give the feedbacks totally anonymously.

Front-end part of the project is implemented using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). ReactJS for Web app and Flutter for Web as well as Android platform. [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) which is an UI component-based library for ReactJS. Flutter provides multi-platform support with single codebase. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) as the backend for server-side handling and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database. With this project we are able to create feedback for faculty as well as courses, faculty members will be able to see their own analytics of the feedback created, and faculty member can see the course analytics respective to their institute and department.
